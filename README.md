This project started because I was unsatisfied with the highly structured methods of creating tunings used by many in the xenharmonic community. While these methods are powerful in ways I still don't trully understand, that predetermined structure also has a tendency to limit what a tuning of scale could look like - thereby limiting the imagination. While I should also admit that the (probably unintentionally) obscurant use of excentric terminology made it difficult for me to get into them, I still feel that this, to my knowledge, novel method should be of some use.

This way of tuning scales is based on a realisation about the fundimentals of what a really scale is: that they can be conceptualised as grids (as in Grid Theory) where nodes represent notes and edges represent intervals. By repeatedly traversing paths to a note in the scale and taking geometric means at various points, a tuning for all notes in the scale can be reached. Due to the inherently explosive growth of path cardinality in graphs, this process can take a very long time. So, an arbitrary lower weight limit is used, which nonetheless has minimal impact on the final tuning of each note.

To experiment for yourself take a look at the file TuningMaker.cpp. Feel free to reach out with any questions, corrections, or comments.

P.S. I intend to make a YouTube video explaining the idea within the year. For those looking for a paper on this method, there is one that I wrote but there are a few things I need to update about it and it's low on my to-do list as I feel like without links to academia a YouTube video will have more reach.
