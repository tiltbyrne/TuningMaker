This is a personal project I've been working on on and off for a few years. It started because I was unsatisfied with the highly structured methods of creating novel tuning used by many in the xenharmonic community. While these structures are powerful in ways I myself still don't feel I confident to explain, that predetermined structure also has a tendency to limit what a tuning of scale could look like - thereby limiting the imagination. I should also admit that the (probably unintentionally) obscurant use of excentric terminology made it difficult for me to get into them.

This way of doing things is based on a back-to-basics realisation about scales I had: that they are basically just grids (as in Grid Theory) where nodes represent notes and edges represent intervals. To experiment for yourself take a look at the file called TuningMaker. I won't go into more detail here but if you're interested feel free to reach out.

P.S. I intend to make a YouTube video explaining the idea within the year. For those looking for a paper on this method, there is one that I wrote but there are a few things I need to update about it and it's low on my to-do list as I feel like without links to academia a YouTube video will have more reach.
