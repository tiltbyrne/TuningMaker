This project started because I was unsatisfied with the methods of creating tunings used by many in the xenharmonic community. While the structured nature of these methods make them very powerful, that same predetermined structure also has a tendency to limit what a scale's tuning could look like. While I should also admit that the unintentionally obscurant use of highly specialised terminology made it difficult for me to get into them, I still feel that this method should be of some use to anyone who enjoys experimenting with tuning. Fundimental to the method is the observation that a scale can be conceptualised as a grid (as in Grid Theory) where nodes represent notes and edges represent intervals. A tuning of all notes in a scale can be reached by periodically taking the geometric mean of the results of subpaths of paths to to a all notes in that scale. Due to the inherently explosive growth of path cardinality in graphs, computing such a tuning can take a very long time. So, an arbitrary lower interval weight limit is used, which nonetheless has minimal impact on the final tuning of each note.

To experiment for yourself take a look at the file TuningMaker.cpp. Feel free to reach out with any questions, corrections, or comments.

P.S. I intend to make a YouTube video explaining the idea within the year. For those looking for a paper on this method, there is one but it needs to be updated, which is low on my to-do list as I feel that without links to academia a YouTube video will have more reach.
